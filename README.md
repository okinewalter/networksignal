# Network Signals App

## Overview

This school project involves the development of a Network Signals application using Django, Bootstrap, and htmx. The primary goal of this app is to record and display network signals at specific locations, allowing users to search for areas with strong network signals in a specified location.

## Features

- **Location-Based Signal Recording**: Users can record network signals at specific locations, providing valuable data about signal strength in different areas.

- **Search Functionality**: The app enables users to search for locations within a specified area and view the recorded network signals, helping them identify areas with strong network coverage.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the network signal data.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for building responsive and visually appealing web pages.

- **htmx**: A library for creating dynamic web pages using HTML, allowing for seamless updates and interactions without the need for extensive JavaScript code.
